A restaurant landing page.

Design made with figma and can be seen on
https://www.figma.com/file/DEy0qv2hCnmQkwgRfwjDlr/Restaurant-page?node-id=0%3A1

The main aim of this project:

- Create a responsive web page
- Create a good looking design
- Improve CSS skills

I might work on the other pages later and update the repo.
